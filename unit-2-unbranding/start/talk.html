  <h1>A Conversation</h1>



<p class="Ashley">We need to talk.</p>

<p class="Sophie">Okay, whats up?</p>

<p class="Ashley">The other day I was looking for my new water bottle and I couldnt find it and I checked everywhere</p>

<p class="Sophie"> Did you check your car? You always leave your bottles in your car</p>

<p class="Ashley"> Yes I did, it wasnt there</p>

<p class="Sophie">Hmmm that is weird. Is there any other place it could be? Do you think someone took it? </p>

<p class="Ashley"> Thats the thing. I have been looking everywhere and I cant find it. But guess who walked in to class with the exact same one!</p>

<p class="Sophie"> Who?? </p>

<p class="Ashley"> Daelyn!!!!</p>

<p class="Sophie"> Omg no way??? Thats crazy</p>

<p class="Ashley"> What should I do? I cant believe she would steal from me</p>
